This was made over the course of a few hours so its a bit rough.

Using this tool you can generate colour(or color) palettes based on a png file.

To use:
	Take your photo, if the image isn't a png open it in paint and save it as "Colour.png"
Then move this image to the data folder in the folder containing the .exe . If there is
already an image in the folder make a copy if needed, then overwrite that "Colour.png".

In the program you will start wit a completely random colour palette. 
From this you can do three things:
1: Press "R" to regenerate a completely random image.
2: Press "P" to generate a palette from your image.
3: Press "S" to save the palette as a 512X512 image.

I hope this is helpful for whatever ypu're working on.
